SORT
Use the SORT command to sort rows on one or more fields:
    ```FROM employees
    | KEEP first_name, last_name, height
    | SORT height```
The default sort order is ascending. Set an explicit sort order using
ASC or DESC:
    ```FROM employees
    | KEEP first_name, last_name, height
    | SORT height DESC```
Two rows with the same sort key are considered equal. You can provide
additional sort expressions to act as tie breakers:
    ```FROM employees
    | KEEP first_name, last_name, height
    | SORT height DESC, first_name ASC```
null values
By default, null values are treated as being larger than any other
value. With an ascending sort order, null values are sorted last, and
with a descending sort order, null values are sorted first. You can
change that by providing NULLS FIRST or NULLS LAST:
    ```FROM employees
    | KEEP first_name, last_name, height
    | SORT first_name ASC NULLS FIRST```
