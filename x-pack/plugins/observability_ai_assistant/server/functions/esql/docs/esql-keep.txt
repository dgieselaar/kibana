commands
KEEP
The KEEP command enables you to specify what columns are returned and
the order in which they are returned.
To limit the columns that are returned, use a comma-separated list of
column names. The columns are returned in the specified order:
    FROM employees
    | KEEP emp_no, first_name, last_name, height
  emp_no:integer   first_name:keyword   last_name:keyword   height:double
  ---------------- -------------------- ------------------- ---------------
  10001            Georgi               Facello             2.03
  10002            Bezalel              Simmel              2.08
  10003            Parto                Bamford             1.83
  10004            Chirstian            Koblick             1.78
  10005            Kyoichi              Maliniak            2.05
Rather than specify each column by name, you can use wildcards to return
all columns with a name that matches a pattern:
    FROM employees
    | KEEP h*
The asterisk wildcard (*) by itself translates to all columns that do
not match the other arguments. This query will first return all columns
with a name that starts with an h, followed by all other columns:
    FROM employees
    | KEEP h*, *
