ENRICH
You can use ENRICH to add data from your existing indices to incoming
records. It’s similar to ingest enrich, but it works at query time.
    ROW language_code = "1"
    | ENRICH languages_policy
  language_code:keyword   language_name:keyword
  ----------------------- -----------------------

ENRICH requires an enrich policy to be executed. The enrich policy
defines a match field (a key field) and a set of enrich fields.
ENRICH will look for records in the enrich index based on the match
field value. The matching key in the input dataset can be defined using
ON <field-name>; if it’s not specified, the match will be performed on a
field with the same name as the match field defined in the enrich
policy.
    ROW a = "1"
    | ENRICH languages_policy ON a
  a:keyword   language_name:keyword
  ----------- -----------------------

You can specify which attributes (between those defined as enrich fields
in the policy) have to be added to the result, using
WITH <field1>, <field2>... syntax.
    ROW a = "1"
    | ENRICH languages_policy ON a WITH language_name
  a:keyword   language_name:keyword
  ----------- -----------------------
  1           English
Attributes can also be renamed using WITH new_name=<field1>
    ROW a = "1"
    | ENRICH languages_policy ON a WITH name = language_name
  a:keyword   name:keyword
  ----------- --------------
  1           English
By default (if no WITH is defined), ENRICH will add all the enrich
fields defined in the enrich policy to the result.
In case of name collisions, the newly created fields will override the
existing fields.
