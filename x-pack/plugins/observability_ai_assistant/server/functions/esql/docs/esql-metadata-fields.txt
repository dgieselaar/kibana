ES|QL metadata fields
ES|QL can access metadata fields. The currently supported ones are:
-   _index: the index to which the document belongs. The field is of the
    type keyword.
-   _id: the source document’s ID. The field is of the type keyword.
-   _version: the source document’s version. The field is of the type
    long.
To enable the access to these fields, the FROM source command needs to
be provided with a dedicated directive:
    FROM index [METADATA _index, _id]
Metadata fields are only available if the source of the data is an
index. Consequently, FROM is the only source commands that supports the
METADATA directive.
Once enabled, the fields are then available to subsequent processing
commands, just like the other index fields:
    FROM ul_logs, apps [METADATA _index, _version]
    | WHERE id IN (13, 14) AND _version == 1
    | EVAL key = CONCAT(_index, "_", TO_STR(id))
    | SORT id, _index
    | KEEP id, _index, _version, key
  id:long   _index:keyword   _version:long   key:keyword
  --------- ---------------- --------------- -------------
  13        apps             1               apps_13
  13        ul_logs          1               ul_logs_13
  14        apps             1               apps_14
  14        ul_logs          1               ul_logs_14
Also, similar to the index fields, once an aggregation is performed, a
metadata field will no longer be accessible to subsequent commands,
unless used as grouping field:
    FROM employees [METADATA _index, _id]
    | STATS max = MAX(emp_no) BY _index
  max:integer   _index:keyword
  ------------- ----------------
  10100         employees
