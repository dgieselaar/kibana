STATS ... BY
Use STATS ... BY to group rows according to a common value and calculate
one or more aggregated values over the grouped rows.
    ```FROM employees
    | STATS count = COUNT(emp_no) BY languages
    | SORT languages```

If BY is omitted, the output table contains exactly one row with the
aggregations applied over the entire dataset:
    ```FROM employees
    | STATS avg_lang = AVG(languages)```

It’s possible to calculate multiple values:
    ```FROM employees
    | STATS avg_lang = AVG(languages), max_lang = MAX(languages)``

It’s also possible to group by multiple values (only supported for long
and keyword family fields):
    ```FROM employees
    | EVAL hired = DATE_FORMAT(hire_date, "YYYY")
    | STATS avg_salary = AVG(salary) BY hired, languages.long
    | EVAL avg_salary = ROUND(avg_salary)
    | SORT hired, languages.long```
    
The following aggregation functions are supported:
-   AVG
-   COUNT
-   COUNT_DISTINCT
-   MAX
-   MEDIAN
-   MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION
-   MIN
-   PERCENTILE
-   SUM

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A SINGLE FIELD NAME FOR THESE AGGREGATION FUNCTIONS.
