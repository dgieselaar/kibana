FROM 
ES|QL ›ES|QL source commands
FROM
The FROM source command returns a table with up to 10,000 documents from
a data stream, index, or alias. Each row in the resulting table
represents a document. Each column corresponds to a field, and can be
accessed by the name of that field.
    FROM employees
You can use date math to refer to indices, aliases and data streams.
This can be useful for time series data, for example to access today’s
index:
    FROM <logs-{now/d}>
Use comma-separated lists or wildcards to query multiple data streams,
indices, or aliases:
    FROM employees-00001,employees-*
Use the METADATA directive to enable metadata fields:
    FROM employees [METADATA _id]
