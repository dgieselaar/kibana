ES|QL syntax reference
Basic syntax
An ES|QL query is composed of a source command followed by an optional
series of processing commands, separated by a pipe character: |. For
example:
    source-command
    | processing-command1
    | processing-command2
The result of a query is the table produced by the final processing
command.
For readability, this documentation puts each processing command on a
new line. However, you can write an ES|QL query as a single line. The
following query is identical to the previous one:
    source-command | processing-command1 | processing-command2
Comments
ES|QL uses C++ style comments:
-   double slash // for single line comments
-   /* and */ for block comments
    // Query the employees index
    FROM employees
    | WHERE height > 2
    FROM /* Query the employees index */ employees
    | WHERE height > 2
    FROM employees
    /* Query the
     * employees
     * index */
    | WHERE height > 2
Operators
These binary comparison operators are supported:
-   equality: ==
-   inequality: !=
-   less than: <
-   less than or equal: <=
-   larger than: >
-   larger than or equal: >=
The IN operator allows testing whether a field or expression equals an
element in a list of literals, fields or expressions:
    ROW a = 1, b = 4, c = 3
    | WHERE c-a IN (3, b / 2, a)
For string comparison using wildcards or regular expressions, use LIKE
or RLIKE:
-   Use LIKE to match strings using wildcards. The following wildcard
    characters are supported:
    -   * matches zero or more characters.
    -   ? matches one character.
        FROM employees
        | WHERE first_name LIKE "?b*"
        | KEEP first_name, last_name
-   Use RLIKE to match strings using regular expressions:
        FROM employees
        | WHERE first_name RLIKE ".leja.*"
        | KEEP first_name, last_name
The following boolean operators are supported:
-   AND
-   OR
-   NOT
Predicates
For NULL comparison use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL predicates:
    FROM employees
    | WHERE birth_date IS NULL
    | KEEP first_name, last_name
    | SORT first_name
    | LIMIT 3
  first_name:keyword   last_name:keyword

Timespan literals
Datetime intervals and timespans can be expressed using timespan
literals. Timespan literals are a combination of a number and a
qualifier. These qualifiers are supported:
-   millisecond/milliseconds
-   second/seconds
-   minute/minutes
-   hour/hours
-   day/days
-   week/weeks
-   month/months
-   year/years
Timespan literals are not whitespace sensitive. These expressions are
all valid:
-   1day
-   1 day
-   1 day
