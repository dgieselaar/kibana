RENAME
Use RENAME to rename a column using the following syntax:
    RENAME <old-name> AS <new-name>
For example:
    FROM employees
    | KEEP first_name, last_name, still_hired
    | RENAME  still_hired AS employed
If a column with the new name already exists, it will be replaced by the
new column.
Multiple columns can be renamed with a single RENAME command:
    FROM employees
    | KEEP first_name, last_name
    | RENAME first_name AS fn, last_name AS ln
