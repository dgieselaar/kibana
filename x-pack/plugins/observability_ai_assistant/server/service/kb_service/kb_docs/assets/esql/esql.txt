ES|QL 

The Elasticsearch Query Language (ES|QL) is a query language that
enables the iterative exploration of data.
An ES|QL query consists of a series of commands, separated by pipes.
Each query starts with a source command. A source command produces a
table, typically with data from Elasticsearch.
[A source command producing a table from Elasticsearch]
A source command can be followed by one or more processing commands.
Processing commands change an input table by adding, removing, or
changing rows and columns.
[A processing command changing an input table]
You can chain processing commands, separated by a pipe character: |.
Each processing command works on the output table of the previous
command.
[Processing commands can be chained]
The result of a query is the table produced by the final processing
command.
Run an ES|QL query
The ES|QL API
Use the _query endpoint to run an ES|QL query:
    POST /_query
    {
      "query": """
        FROM library
        | EVAL year = DATE_TRUNC(1 YEARS, release_date)
        | STATS MAX(page_count) BY year
        | SORT year
        | LIMIT 5
      """
    }

ES|QL currently supports the following field types:
-   alias
-   boolean
