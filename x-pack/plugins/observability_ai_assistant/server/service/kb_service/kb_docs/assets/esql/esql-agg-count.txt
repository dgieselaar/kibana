COUNT
Counts field values.
    FROM employees
    | STATS COUNT(height)
  COUNT(height):long
  --------------------
  100
Can take any field type as input and the result is always a long not
matter the input type.

COUNT requires a single argument. Please count a single valued field
if you need a count of rows. It's not like SQL, where you can use a
wildcard or without an argument. If you don't have any field name to
count by, ask the user for one. These rules apply in no matter what
context COUNT is used.
